// Maximum Number of Events That Can Be Attended II
// ðŸ”´ HARD

// why it is hard? // This problem is considered hard because it involves dynamic programming 
// with a binary search optimization, which can be complex to implement correctly. 
// The challenge lies in efficiently managing overlapping events and maximizing the total value while adhering to constraints.

// why we are sorting the events? // We sort the events by their end times to facilitate the binary search for the last non-overlapping event,
// which allows us to efficiently compute the maximum value of attended events without overlaps.

// why we are using binary search? // We use binary search to quickly find the last event that ends before the start of the current event,
// why we are using dynamic programming? we have two choices for each event: either attend it or skip it.
// Dynamic programming helps us build a solution incrementally, storing intermediate results to avoid redundant calculations.
